<p>This is a proof-of-concept for a central "perl community hub" - a single place where all perl people can come to find out what's going on in the perl world. The basic idea is</p>

<ul>
<li>you would log in, using your PAUSE id, twitter, facebook, etc</li>
<li>you could configure what you'd see on the front page</li>
<li>you would provide details of your blog, any talks you've given, links to perl resources you've found</li>
</ul>

<p>This is just a mashup, built with the build-hub script. This does the following</p>

<ul>
<li>reads the list of perl blogs from conf/blogs.json</li>
<li>reads the list of upcoming events conf/events.json</li>
<li>reads the list of talks from conf/talks.json</li>
<li>reads the list of links to perl resources from conf/links.json</li>
</ul>

<p>It also grabs various perl related feeds, in some cases munges them, and maps them into the feeds
at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>If you want to add your blog, details of talks you've given, or any links I've missed,
either send me a pull request, or raise an issue on github.</p>

<p>You can read more about the idea on my <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/neilb/2013/03/idea-perl-community-homepage.html">blog post</a></p>
